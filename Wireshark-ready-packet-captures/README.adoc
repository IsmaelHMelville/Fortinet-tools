= Wireshark-ready packet captures
:toc: 

== Description

I collect here packet captures done on Fortinet equipment of different kinds, mostly on Fortigates, but not only.


== BGP

Topology for the packet capture:

image::bgp-topology-1.png[]

Capture was done on FGT1. 

FGT1: 13.13.13.1

FGT-BGP: 13.13.13.13

NOTE: Disable rule colorization or it will be all red - limiations of virtual environment sniffing.

First TCP port 179 connection is set up. The BGP OPEN messages are sent by both peers, then peers exchange UPDATE messages listing their routes (NLRIs).
