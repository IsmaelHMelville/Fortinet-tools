= Back up configuration when changed to external server via SFTP

_Task_: When an administrator changes the configuration, back it up after she
logs out of the Fortigate. This will back up the _changed_ configuration.

Fortigate can do back ups using TFTP (unsecure and unreliable), FTP (unsecure
but reliable), and SFTP (secure and reliable) protocols. I will be using the
SFTP and back up to an external server (RHEL) _10.10.10.13_. SFTP works over the
SSH tunnel, so no additional configurations beyond user/SSH on the server are
needed in most cases. 

Here:

* _10.10.10.13_ Linux server with SSH open to the Fortigate.
* _fgtbackup_ User on the Linux server.
* _fgPW39--7_ Password of the user _fgtbaclup_ on the server.

WARNING: The password for the user will be stored in clear text inside the
configuration and so will be present in the back up as well. I couldn't find the
way to prevent this, the variations of `exe backup obfuscated-config` do not
help here, so be aware. 


* Trigger: when the configuration changed and admin logs out

----
config sys automation-trigger
    edit "ConfigChanged_trigger"
        set event-type config-change
    next 
end
----


* Action: run back up command on the CLI:

----
config sys automation-ation
    edit "ConfigBackupOnChange"
        set action-type cli-script
        set script " exe backup config sftp fgtconfig-%%date%%-%%time%%.conf
10.10.10.13 fgtbackup fgPW39--7"
        set accprofile "super_admin"
    next
end
----

NOTE: `%%date%%` and `%%time%%` will be converted to the actual date and time
when the back up is run.

The result will look like this on  the server:

----
# ls -1
fgtconfig-2023-03-14-11:20:49.conf
fgtconfig-2023-03-14-11:50:15.conf
----

I can easily see the changes made in each administrator session using
built-tools like `diff` on the server.


* Stitch to combine the above:

----
config sys automation-stitch
    edit "BackUpOnConfigChange"
        set trigger "ConfigChanged_trigger"
        config actions
            edit 1
                set action "ConfigBackupOnChange"
                set required enable
            next
        end
    next
end
----


As an option, run the back up and send email alert that configuration has
changed:


----
config sys automation-stitch
    edit "BackUpOnConfigChange"
        set trigger "ConfigChanged_trigger"
        config actions
            edit 1
                set action "ConfigBackupOnChange"
                set required enable
            next
            edit 2
                set action "ConfigChanged_email"
                set required enable
            next
        end
    next
end
----
