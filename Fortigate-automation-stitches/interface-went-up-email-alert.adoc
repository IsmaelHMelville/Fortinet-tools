= Any of Fortigate interfaces goes up, send an email alert

_Task_ We want to get email alert on any of the Fortigate interfaces changing
status to _up. 


NOTE: We cannot create a stitch combining both _up_ and _down_ changes, 
need to create a stitch for each.

The trigger for interface going up:

----
config system automation-trigger
    edit "Interface_up_trigger"
        set event-type event-log
        set logid 20099
        config fields
            edit 1
                set name "status"
                set value "up"
            next
        end
    next
end
----

Action to send email alert (make sure mail server is configured in `config sys
email-server`):

----
config system automation-action
    next
    edit "Interfaceup_email"
        set action-type email
        set email-to "admin@yurisk.info"
        set email-from "fgt@yurisk.info"
        set email-subject "Interface went up"
        set email-subject "%%log.logdesc%%"
    next
end
----


Stitch itself:

----
config system automation-stitch
    edit "Interface_went_up_stitch"
        set trigger "Interface_up_trigger"
        config actions
            edit 1
                set action "Interfaceup_email"
                set required enable
            next
        end
    next
end
