= Collection of Fortigate Automation Stitches
:toc:

== Important facts
* If you have VDOMs enabled, you find Automation Stitches GUI menu 
under the _Global_ section.
* When VDOMs are enabled, any networking with external to Fortigate hosts will happen with source  IP and from 
the _administrative_ VDOM (usually `root`). E.g. auto-backup of configuration to external server etc. It means you need to 
have security rules in _admin_ VDOM accordingly to allow such communication.
* When using email as alert action, make sure you have configured mail server 
to relay these alerts. On CLI it is in `config sys email-server`, and in GUI it
is in the System -> Settings. 
* It is recommended to configure PTR record for the sending IP of the Fortigate,
as well as SPF record in the domain you're sending from, to prevent mails being
marked as spam.
* Trigger _Field Conditions_ - they match on either exact values or wildcards, no regex, no
ranges for numeric values. Also no partial match, so you cannot match _"Interface
down"_ string with a word _"down"_, unless using wildcard +++*down*+++.
* Bugs are always possible, e.g. for the built-in stitch _Reboot_, even though
it works and fires, the _trigger count_ stays 0. 
* These types of stitches have _Test automation stitch_ grayed out:
** Event Log based.
** Configuration change.
** Reboot.
** License expiration.
** HA failover.
** Scheduled.
* For scheduled triggers make sure Fortigate has reliable time source, like NTP.

== All about email alerts

* With VDOMs enabled, the email is sent from the _administrative_ VDOM (usually
_root_) with the source IP defined by the routing table.
* All the fields you see in the Fortigate *raw log* are available to be included in the email message.
* When sending an email as action, based on log events, the body will contain the complete log
(`%%log%%`) by default, no need to do anything for that. But, if you do NOT want to include
log, for privacy reasons, set the `message` parameter to anything else:

----
config sys automation-action
    edit "EmailWithoutBody"
        set action-type email
        set email-to "admin@yurisk.info"
        set email-from "fgt@yurisk.info"
        set email-subject "The stitch has fired"
        set message "This text replaces the full log in the body."
    next
end
----
* Use specific log field surrounded with double `%` to include it in the message when the trigger is FortiOS Log Event. E.g. to include username of the admin that logged in the subject, and the source IP,  and _time_ in the message body:

----

config sys automation-action
    edit ""AdminLoggedIn"
        set action-type email
        set email-to "admin@yurisk.info"
        set email-from "fgt@yurisk.info"
        set email-subject "Admin user %%user%% logged in"
        set message  "Source IP: %%srcip%%
Time: %%time%%"
    next
end
----
* There is a special variable `%%results%%` that we can use in the Actions, it will be replaced with the output of the previously run command. E.g. you can create 2-step actions, 1st action runs some CLI debug on the Fortigate, the 2nd action sends the debug output by email, see example here: link:fortiguard-servers-unreachable-email-alert.adoc[Send email alert on FortiGuard servers becoming unreachable and attach debug output ]. Be aware that it will include sensitive info if presented on CLI as well.
* For anything you send in the email body, there is a limit of 16 KBytes, may differ by model. 
* Email server for sending alerts is configured under System -> Settings, or on CLI:

----
config system email-server
    set reply-to "fgt@yurisk.info" // MAIL FROM field is taken from here, unless set in the stitch action
    set server "192.0.0.1" 
    set authenticate enable
    set username "secret@yurisk.info"
    set password s$cr$t
end
----


== Debug
* *diag test app autod 2* Show all enabled stitches with their settings.
* *diag test app autod 3* Show statistics for all enabled stitches, including numbers run (_hit_).
* Email sending debug: *dia debug app alertmail -1*. This will show the whole mail sending session.
* Reboot zeroizes the stitches statistics.
* Some stitches have right click -> _Test automation stitch_ menu so that you can
trigger the stitch to see if it works. The CLI analog is *diagnose automation test <stitch name> <log if needed>*.
* Live debug:
** *diag debug reset* To reset any previous debug, just in case.
** *diag test app autod 1* Enable automation stitches logging.
** *diag debug cli 7* Show stitches' running log on the CLI.
** *diag debug enable* Enable debug.
**  right click -> _Test automation stitch_ menu or *diagnose automation test <stitch name> <log if needed>*.
* Log-based stitches have the menu _Test automation stitch_ grayed out, and we
can only trigger them for testing if we input the real log on the CLI. This will
also insert this log into the Fortigate logs as if it really happened. Example
of such log supplied on CLI, pay attention to every quote " being escaped and
log should be a single line:
