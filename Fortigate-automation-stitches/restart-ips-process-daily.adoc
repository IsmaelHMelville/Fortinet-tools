= Restart IPS process daily 

_Task_: We need to restart `IPS` process daily as a workaround for its memory 
leaking . The process restart will happen at 02:10 at night.



* Create an action of restarting ips process on CLI:

----
config sys automation-action
    edit "ScheduleipsRestart"
        set action-type cli-script
        set script "diagnose test application ipsmonitor 99"
        set accprofile "super_admin"
    next
end
----

* Create a daily schedule (every day at 02:10 at night):

----
config system automation-trigger
    edit "Daily_trigger"
        set trigger-type scheduled
        set trigger-frequency daily
        set trigger-hour 2
        set trigger-minute 10
    next
end
----

* Stitch to combine the 2 above:

----
config sys automation-stitch
    edit "ScheduledReboot_stitch"
        set status disable
        set trigger "Daily_trigger"
        config actions
            edit 1
                set action "ScheduleipsRestart"
                set required enable
            next
        end
    next
end
----
