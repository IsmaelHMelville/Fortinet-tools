= Restart both - IPS and WAD processes to prevent Conserve Mode 

_Task_: To prevent memory leak by those 2 processes, restart them weekly.


* Create 2 actions to restart each process:


----
config sys automation-action
    edit "WADRestart"
        set action-type cli-script
        set script "diagnose test application wad 99"
        set accprofile "super_admin"
    next
end
----


----
config sys automation-action
    edit "IPSsRestart"
        set action-type cli-script
        set script "diagnose test application ipsmonitor 99"
        set accprofile "super_admin"
    next
end
----

* Create a weekly scheduled trigger, here - each Sunday at 02:00 AM:

----
config system automation-trigger
    edit "Weekly_trigger"
        set trigger-type scheduled
        set trigger-frequency weekly
        set trigger-weekday sunday
        set trigger-hour 2
    next
end
----


* Combine the above to an automation stitch:

----
config sys automation-stitch
    edit "ScheduleWADIPSRestart_stitch"
        set trigger "Weekly_trigger"
        config actions
            edit 1
            set action "WADRestart"
            set required enable
            next
        edit 2
            set action "IPSsRestart"
            set required enable
            next
            end
        next
end
