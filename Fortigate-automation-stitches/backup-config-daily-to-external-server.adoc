= Back up configuration daily to external server via SFTP

_Task_: Nightly (at 02:00 am) back up the Fortigate configuration to external server (10.10.10.13) via SFTP protocol. 

Fortigate can do back ups using TFTP (unsecure and unreliable), FTP (unsecure
but reliable), and SFTP (secure and reliable) protocols. I will be using the
SFTP to back up to an external server (RHEL) _10.10.10.13_. SFTP works over the
SSH tunnel, so no additional configurations beyond user/SSH on the server are
needed in most cases. 

Here:

* _10.10.10.13_ Linux server with SSH open to the Fortigate.
* _fgtbackup_ User on the Linux server.
* _fgPW39--7_ Password of the user _fgtbaclup_ on the server.

WARNING: The password for the user will be stored in clear text inside the Fortigate 
configuration and so will be present in the backup on the server as well. I couldn't find the
way to prevent this, the variations of `exe backup obfuscated-config` do not
help here, so be aware. 


* Trigger: When Fortigate time reaches 02:00 am, run this trigger


----
condfig sys automation-trigger
    edit "ScheduledBackup_trigger"
        set trigger-type scheduled
        set trigger-hour 2
        set trigger-minute 0
     next
end
----



* Action: run backup command on the CLI:

----
config sys automation-ation
    edit "ConfigBackupOnSchedule"
        set action-type cli-script
        set script " exe backup config sftp fgtconfig-%%date%%-%%time%%.conf
10.10.10.13 fgtbackup fgPW39--7"
        set accprofile "super_admin"
    next
end
----

NOTE: `%%date%%` and `%%time%%` will be converted to the actual date and time
when the backup is run.

The result will look like this on  the server:

----
# ls -1
fgtconfig-2023-03-14-02:00:49.conf
fgtconfig-2023-03-14-02:00:15.conf
----

This way, we can easily compare and see the changes made during this day using
Linux built-tools like `diff` on the server.


* Stitch to combine the above:

----
config sys automation-stitch
    edit "BackUpOnConfigChange"
        set trigger "ScheduledBackup_trigger"
        config actions
            edit 1
                set action "ConfigBackupOnSchedule"
                set required enable
            next
        end
    next
end
----


As an option, run the backup and send email alert that configuration has
been backed up:


----
config sys automation-stitch
    edit "BackUpOnConfigChange"
        set trigger "ConfigChanged_trigger"
        config actions
            edit 1
                set action "ScheduledBackup_trigger"
                set required enable
            next
            edit 2
                set action "BackUpRun_email"
                set required enable
            next
        end
    next
end
