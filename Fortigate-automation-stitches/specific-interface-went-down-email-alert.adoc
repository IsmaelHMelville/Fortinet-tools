= When  only a given interface goes down, send an email alert

_Task_ We want to get email alert only when interface _port2_ goes down. 


The trigger for interface _port2_  going down:




----
config sys automation-trigger
    edit "Interface_down_trigger"
        set event-type event-log
        set logid 20099
        config fields
            edit 1
                set name "status"
                set value "down"
            next
            edit 2
                set name "msg"
                set value "Link monitor: Interface port2 was turned down"
            next
        end
    next
end

Action to send email alert (make sure mail server is configured in `config sys
email-server`):

----

    edit "InterfaceDown_email"
        set action-type email
        set email-to "admin@yurisk.info"
        set email-from "fgt@yurisk.info"
        set email-subject "Interface port2  went down"
        set email-subject "%%log.logdesc%%"
    next
end
