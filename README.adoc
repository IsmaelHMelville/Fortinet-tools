== Collection of Fortigate automation stitches
This collection is work in progress, and will always be. If you have an idea, or already implemented an automation 
stitch not in the collection, I will be glad to add it for the benefit of all of us - yuri@yurisk.info. Also, if you try some stitch from this repository and things do not work as expected - feel free to open an issue/PR with details. 

Disclaimer: I cannot possibly test contents of this repo on all Fortigate models and FortiOS versions, so cannot guarantee 
that it will work on your gear in your conditions, and cannot predict all possible outcomes, so test before using in production.
